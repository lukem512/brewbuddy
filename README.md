# Brewbuddy
A tool for beermaking (_brewing_). Track recipes and ingredients to, hopefully, allow a proto-brewer to improve.

## How was it made?
The project uses React and Redux. It was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Babel is used, as usual, for transpilation.
